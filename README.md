# SECRRPASS

### Description

A simple password manager developed using `React.js` on the front-end and `Firebase` on the back-end.

There is no need to create a new user account. The first time user visits the app, he/she will be given a unique ID that will then be appended in the URL. At this point, the home screen should be bookmarked so that the next time user wants to "log in," he/she could proceed to `secrrpass.firebaseapp.com/5jsh73`. The account can be protected with a master password if the user wishes to do so.

This app was developed for learning purposes as I wanted to learn `React.js` and `Firebase`.
