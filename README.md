# SECRRPASS

### Description

A simple password manager developed using `React.js` on the front-end and `Firebase` on the back-end.

There is no need to create a user account. The first time user visits the app, he/she will be given a unique ID that will be appended in the URL, for example `secrrpass/e2p3p1`. At this point, the user should bookmark the page so he/she has access to her account. The account can be protected with a `master password` if the user wishes to do so. Typically, the session expires after 10 minutes and will require the user to sign in again the next time he/she opens up the app. 

This app was developed strictly for learning purposes as I wanted to learn `React.js` and `Firebase`

There is no need to create a new user account. The first time user visits the app, he/she will be given a unique ID that will then be appended in the URL. At this point, the home screen should be bookmarked so that the next time user wants to "log in," he/she could proceed to `goto1.github.io/secrrpass/build/5jsh73`. The account can be protected with a master password if the user wishes to do so.

This app was developed for learning purposes as I wanted to learn `React.js` and `Firebase`.
